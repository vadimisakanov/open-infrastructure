I define several points vitally important if we want to implement devops methodology from infrastructure point of view

All of these points should be defined in the project and updated on every update of the project

DevOps main points:

1. IaC
2. Do we have production env? If we do, production env is a great point to consider on every change.
3. Dev & test envs
4. Project code tests & infra tests (all kind - unit, integration, smoke tests, etc)
5. Monitoring - metrics collection & alerts
6. Log processing
7. CI/CD
8. Documentation
9. Bus factor
