#### K8S cluster autoscaler? In Yandex?

K8S cluster autoscaler (scaling worker nodes) is ok in a case you have a working cloud autoscaler provider. Autoscaler in AWS is the simplest one as I've read. I've used autoscaler in Digitalocean, works ok. Scaling down much slower than scaling up is a feature of all autoscaler providers that I've seen.
If Yandex provider doesn't do good, you need to overwrite it. Other option is to use a monitoring script that would scale nodes up and down with stuff like terraform and additional scripting to drain nodes.

#### Integrate Grafana+Prometheus+ELK to see stuff in one place like in Newrelic?

Two options. 1) Use ELK and make a connector between Grafana and Elastic and then collect data from Elastic and Prometheus in one Grafana Dashboard. 2) Use Loki instead of ELK, it has native Grafana support. Then collect data from Loki and Prometheus in one Grafana Dashboard.
